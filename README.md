# Website Redesign Project

This repository contains the redesigned website for **Foxtree Countertops**, aiming to improve user experience, modernize the design, and enhance functionality.

## Overview

The original website for **Foxtree Countertops** was functional, but it lacked modern design aesthetics, and some key features that would improve the overall user experience. It also improved business processes, particularly when handling free bids. This project involved redesigning and developing a new website from scratch with an updated, more visually appealing interface.

### Goals of the Redesign:
- **Modernize the design**: Update the look and feel to align with current design trends.
- **Enhance user experience**: Create a responsive, intuitive layout that works seamlessly across all devices.
- **Implement new features**: Add new functionalities that were missing from the old website (e.g., new free bid process).

## Old Website

Before the redesign, the website had several limitations:

- **Outdated design**: The website used old styles and colors that didn't reflect the brand's current image.
- **Stale content**: The information on the website was no longer relevant, which could confuse or frustrate visitors.

The redesigned website addresses all of the issues of the old one while introducing several new features to enhance user interaction.

### Key Features:
- **Fully responsive design**: The website is now optimized for all screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktops.
- **Modern UI/UX**: Clean design with an updated color palette, typography, and easy navigation.
- **SEO optimized**: Improved on-page SEO to help the website rank higher in search engine results.
